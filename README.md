## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The RandomForestRegressor model from scikit-learn is employed for prediction. The scripts provided include steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Installation
To run the scripts in this repository, you need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/LavanBartha/House-Pricing-Prediction-with-RandomForestRegressor.git
cd house-pricing-prediction

2. Run the Python scripts:
    Predictor.ipynb

3. Check the script for options to modify data paths, model parameters, etc.

4. Files and Directory Structure
